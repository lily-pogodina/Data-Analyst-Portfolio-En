We have a dataset containing historical data on dog bites reported in New York City from 2015-2022.

**`Study Objective`**
* Identify areas of the city where the problem of dog attacks is most acute
* Test the hypothesis that seasonality affects the number of bites
* Identify aggressive breeds

**`Conclusions:`**

* **The hypothesis that seasonality affects the number of attacks was confirmed.** In the winter months, on average, 34.5% fewer cases were recorded than in summer.
* Found out **the leading borough in terms of the number of cases is Staten Island**, where there are an average of 540 attacks per million residents per year.
* In cases where the animal's gender was specified, **males are 2.64 times more common than females**
* **Pit bull terriers lead in the number of attacks by a fairly large margin (14% of all attacks)**, but we cannot draw more detailed conclusions from the available data

**`Tools`**

* Python
  * pandas
  * matplotlib 
  * seaborn
