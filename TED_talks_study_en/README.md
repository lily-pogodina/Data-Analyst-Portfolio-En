TED (from English technology, education, design) is a non-profit foundation that holds popular conferences. They feature experts from various fields who give lectures on current social, cultural and scientific topics.

In this project, we explored the history of TED conferences using Tableau dashboards.

**`Exploratory analysis`**

* **Talks History:**

  * The United States led the world in terms of the number of conferences during the study period.
  * The most popular topics for conferences were science, technology, culture, society, and global issues.
  * The highest number of conferences was held in 2017, after which their number gradually decreased.
  * The fewest meetings were held in 2021 and 2022 during the study period, which is likely due to the pandemic.

* **Speech Topics**

  * The most popular categories are science, technology, and culture.
  * In the countries with the highest number of speeches, science and technology are the most popular topics. In the UK, global issues are slightly more popular. Overall, the distribution of topic popularity is the same.
  * Arts-related speeches, on average, receive the most applause from the audience, while global issues receive the least. The most applause was received by the speech
  Cecile Richards "The political progress women have made -- and what's next"
  * Speeches on the topic of art are also, on average, the funniest, and the most serious ones are on the topic of global problems. The funniest speech was Maz Jobrani "A Saudi, an Indian and an Iranian walk into a Qatari bar ..."
  * There is no correlation between the length of the video and the number of views. The longest video is "3 secrets to Netflix's success". The most views were received by the video "Your body language may shape who you are".

* **Authors of speeches**

  * Architect, artist and writer are the most common professions among the authors of speeches
  * Usually the author speaks only once

* **Changes from 2019 to 2021**

  * There has been a significant decrease in the number of talks between 2019 and 2021, from 243 in 2019 to just 6 in 2021.
  * There has also been a shift in the priorities for talk topics, with global issues, economics, health, and social change becoming more prominent.
  * There has also been a decrease in the number of countries hosting conferences. In 2021, the only host country was the United States, which hosted just 3 conferences.
  * These changes may be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions it has brought about. The pandemic may also have affected both the priorities of the organizers and the choice of specific topics for conferences, as well as the changing interests of the audience.
